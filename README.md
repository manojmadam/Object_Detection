# Object detection using OpenCV

   
 &nbsp; Object detection using OpenCV in Python is a technique that allows you to identify and locate specific objects within an image or a video stream. OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a popular open-source library that provides a wide range of computer vision and image processing functions. Object detection using OpenCV is widely used in various domains, including computer vision research, autonomous vehicles,surveillance systems, robotics.<br>
 &emsp; OpenCV provides a powerful toolset for detecting and localizing objects in images and videos, enabling developers to build intelligent applications with object recognition capabilities.
